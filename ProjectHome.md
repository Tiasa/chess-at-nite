You need to have a g++ compiler installed (MacOS users: download the latest Xcode, Linux users: you know how to get it).

If you don't have a previous version, try doing this:
```
$ svn checkout http://chess-at-nite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ chess-at-nite
$ cd chess-at-nite
$ make
$ cd bin
$ ./chess-at-nite
```

If you want to update your previous version, locate the directory and try this:

```
$ svn update
$ make clean && make
$ cd bin
$ ./chess-at-nite
```
